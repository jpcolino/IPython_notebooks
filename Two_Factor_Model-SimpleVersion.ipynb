    "All over this technical note, we will consider a two-dimensional Brownian motion $B_{S,t},B_{L,t}$ with correlation matrix $\\rho$ on the probability space $(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F},\\mathbb{P} )$ endowed with the natural (completed and right-continuous) filtration $\\mathbb{F}=(\\mathcal{F_t})_{t \\geq T}$ generated by ${B_{S,t},B_{L,t}}$ up to some fixed time horizon $T>0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this section is to define the dynamic of a commodity **forward curve model** based in the following stochastic differential equation (SDE), where we suppose that the uncertainties in the forward price will be explained by the defined Brownian motions ${B_{S,t},B_{L,t}}$ (**Clewlow and Strickland, 1999**): \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation} \n",
    "\\frac{dF(t,T)}{F(t,T)}=\\sigma_{S}(t,T)e^{-a(T-t)}dB_{S,t}+\\sigma_{L}(t,T)dB_{L,t}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where the following are used:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $ F(t,T) $: forward price at time t for delivery of one quantity of the underlying commodity at time T\n",
    "* $ \\sigma_{S}(t,T) $: short-term volatility,\n",
    "* $ \\sigma_{L}(t,T) $: long-term volatility,\n",
    "* $ a $: a mean-reversion speed\n",
    "* $ dB_{S,t} $ and $ dB_{L,t} $: brownian motions with correlation \u001a$\\rho = \\rho(dB_{S,t}, dB_{L,t})$ \n",
    "\n",
    "The two-factors model here introduced assumes the dynamic of forward market prices is described by two distinct sources of risk (random shocks here introduced as gaussian processes or Brownian motions). In this model, the first Brownian motion describes swift changes in the future curve, the second one describes structural changes in the gas market and deals with long term changes in the curve. Due to the decay effect given by the exponential term, the first risk factor affects particularly the behaviour of prices with short-time to delivery (front-end of the forward curve) and hence is usually referred to as **”short-term factor”** and denoted by the sub-index $S$. The second risk factor has the greatest influence on the behaviour of the back-end of the curve (long time-to-delivery) and will be referred to as **”long-term factor”** denoted by the sub-index $L$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the infinitesimal behaviour of the Forward Prices in time $t$,for delivery at time $T$, is clearly random and driven by the following constituents:\n",
    "* the sum of two gaussian process, possibly correlated, here represented by the Brownian motions $B_L$ and $B_S$\n",
    "* the value in $t$ of the forward price, or $F(t,T)$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of viewing the two factors comes from the economic interpretation: The first factor captures the increased trading activity as knowledge about weather, unexpected outages etc. becomes available. The second factor models a long-term uncertainty, that is common to all products in the market. This uncertainty can be explained by technological advances, political changes, price developments in other commodity markets and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main reasons because this is the most extended model in the commodities market to price derivatives and structured products is, not only his **simplicity** and the **flexibility** to represent volatility term structures with exponential-decay pattern, but most importantly, this model is able to **aggregate** the position and hedging of complex derivatives' portfolio with many different maturities in *the two most liquid forward contracts*: calendar contracts representing the ”long-term factor”, and front-month (or weekahead) for the \"short-term\" factor. Or in other words, *the factors are not only tradeable, but the most liquid tradeble products in the market*. \n",

    "In order to get the solution of the previous SDE, we just need to apply Itô’s formula (Kiyosi Itô, 1950) to the $\\log F(t,T)$ taking into account the previous SDE, and integrate the expression to obtain the forward prices:\n",

    "However, the special properties of gas and power markets, especially that of the limited or total non-storability of the underlying commodity, lead to non-validity of the spot-forward relationship here showed. Traditional theory utilises no-arbitrage and cash-and-carry arguments to derive this well-known spot-forward relationship, however the limited (gas) or total non-storability (power) of the underlying commodity implies the break down of traditional cash-and-carry arguments as well as the well-known spot- forward relationship. Additionally, any estimation of the parameters of the SDE for any forward prices model using statistical information from the spot market is wrong."

    "All the mathematical development written above is only valid for intantaneous forward prices, or in other words, forward prices for instantaneous product delivery. In reality, there is no such thing in comodities markets. Forwards contracts in commodities are for a specified delivery period; days, weeks, months, seasons or years. The simulations produced for products with long delivery periods will have volatilies that are too high in reality, because the actual price path within the product is in effect averaged to give the actual product price, and this will affect the volatility of the product itself. It is quite intuitive to expect the volatility of yearly products to be much less than daily products, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this subsection we explain how the instanateous model can be adjusted to describe with accuracy the dynamics of tradeable forward products with longer delivery periods. Given an instanateous forward-price curve (e.g. daily for gas or hourly curve for power), from a simple no arbitrage opportunity argument, it is possible to derive the price for any kind of forward product specified by a delivery time $T$ and a delivery length $\\theta$ where $F_p(t,T,\\theta)$ is defined as\n",

    "Each of these shaping factors can be interpreted as a weight of the hour or day $u \\in [0, \\theta]$ compared with the tradeable forward price of a contract that has 'continuous' delivery inside the interval $[T, T + \\theta]$. They are intuitive in the energy markets as they can be related to the various seasonalities observable in the market (for instance, forward price for delivery on a Monday at 8am is more expensive than for delivery on Sunday at midnight for instance).\n",
