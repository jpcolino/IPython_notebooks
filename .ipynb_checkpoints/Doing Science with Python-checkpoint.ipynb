    "The float type also supports the normal arithmetic operations, as well as several rounding options. Python floats are based on the Institute of Electrical & Electronic Engineering (IEEE) standards and have the same ranges as the underlying computer architecture. They also suffer the same levels of imprecision that make comparing float values a risky option (see next section 'Some Pitfalls in Numerical Computing'). Python provides modules for handling fixed precision decimal numbers (decimal) and rational fractions (fractions) to help alleviate this issue. Python also natively supports a complex, or imaginary, number type called complex. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before to go deep into details, you need to be aware of some underlying concepts in Python: \n",
    "\n",
    "* *First*, Python variables are just names. You create variable names by assigning them to objects that are instances of types. Variables do not, of themselves, have a type; it is the object to which they are bound that has a type. The name is just a label and, as such, it can be reassigned to a completely different object.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Second*, Python groups types according to how you can use them. For example, all types are either categorized as *mutable* or *immutable*. If a type is immutable, it means you can’t change an object of that type once it’s created. You can create a new data item and assign it to the same variable, but you cannot change the original immutable value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Third*, Python also supports several collection types, sometimes referred to as sequences or data containers. Sequences share a common set of operations, although not all sequences support all of the operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* And *fourth*, some Python data types are *callable*. That means you can use the type name like a function to produce a new instance of the type. If no value is given, a default value is returned. You will see examples of this behavior in the following descriptions of the individual data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Python has a huge number of libraries included with the distribution. To keep things simple, most of these variables and functions are not accessible in a Python session. Instead, you have to **import** the name. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, there is a **math** module containing many useful functions. To access, say, the square root function, you can either first\n",
    "\n",
    "    from math import sqrt\n",

For instance, in the iteration in the sidebar to compute the solution of $3x^3+4=28$, after $10$ or so iterations, we conclude that the root is roughly $1.99$ (for example).

    "\n",
    "Given a collection of items, a **hash function** that maps each item into a unique slot is referred to as a **perfect hash function**. If we know the items and the collection will never change, then it is possible to construct a perfect hash function (refer to the exercises for more about perfect hash functions). Unfortunately, given an arbitrary collection of items, there is no systematic way to construct a perfect hash function.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to always have a perfect hash function is to increase the size of the hash table so that each possible value in the item range can be accommodated. This guarantees that each item will have a unique slot. Although this is practical for small numbers of items, it is not feasible when the number of possible items is large. For example, if the items were nine-digit Social Security numbers, this method would require almost one billion slots. If we only want to store data for a class of 25 students, we will be wasting an enormous amount of memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to create a hash function that minimizes the number of collisions, is easy to compute, and evenly distributes the items in the hash table. There are a number of common ways to extend the simple remainder method. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **folding method** for constructing hash functions begins by dividing the item into equal-size pieces (the last piece may not be of equal size). These pieces are then added together to give the resulting hash value. For example, if our item was the phone number 436-555-4601, we would take the digits and divide them into groups of 2 (43,65,55,46,01). After the addition, 43+65+55+46+01, we get 210. If we assume our hash table has 11 slots, then we need to perform the extra step of dividing by 11 and keeping the remainder. In this case 210 % 11 is 1, so the phone number 436-555-4601 hashes to slot 1. Some folding methods go one step further and reverse every other piece before the addition. For the above example, we get 43+56+55+64+01=219 which gives 219 % 11=10.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also create hash functions for character-based items such as strings. The word “abcdef” can be thought of as a sequence of ordinal values.We can then take these six ordinal values, add them up, and use the remainder method to get a hash value:"

    "# Plotting with Matplotlib\n",
    "First rule in statisitcal modelling, plot your data if you can. Python has a great plotting library called [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.sf.net). The IPython notebook interface we are using for these notes has that functionality built in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is an excellent 2D and 3D graphics library for generating scientific figures. Some of the many advantages of this library includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Easy to get started\n",
    "* Support for $\\LaTeX$ formatted labels and texts\n",
    "* Great control of every element in a figure, including figure size and DPI. \n",
    "* High-quality output in many formats, including PNG, PDF, SVG, EPS.\n",
    "* GUI for interactively exploring figures *and* support for headless generation of figure files (useful for batch jobs).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `matplotlib.pyplot` module contains the API for functions, such as `plot`.  The convention is to import it as `plt`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "    \n",
    "You can lauch IPython with `matplotlib` integration by typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ipython --pylab\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ipython notebook --pylab=inline\n",
    "    \n",
    "These two methods are the best ways to use matplotlib interactively.  We you do this, you will have access to several `numpy` and `pyplot` in the same namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, we have looked at two different functions, the Fibonacci function, and the factorial function, both of which grow faster than polynomially. Which one grows the fastest? Let's plot them."

[Scipy](http://scipy) contains additional routines for optimization, special functions, and so on. Both contain modules written in C and Fortran so that they're as fast as possible. Together, they give Python roughly the same capability that the [Matlab](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) program offers, but with an increase of speed that use to be higher than x300.

You can pass in a second argument to **array** that gives the numeric type. There are a number of types [listed here](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.types.html) that your matrix can be. Some of these are aliased to single character codes. The most common ones are 'd' (double precision floating point number), 'D' (double precision complex number), and 'i' (int32). "

    "\n",
    "In this example, we aim to show how to integrate NumPy arrays and Cython code. We will also see how calls to Python functions inside tight loops can be optimized by converting the Python functions into C functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we simulate an sample of a stochastic process simulation, namely a **Brownian motion**. This process describes the trajectory of a particle starting at `x=0`, and making random steps of `+dx` or `-dx` at each discrete time step (also called *random walk*), with `dx` being a small constant. This type of process appears frequently in finance, economy, physics, biology, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "This specific process can be simulated very efficiently using **NumPy** methods on `ndarrays` as `cumsum()` and `rand()` functions. However, more complex processes may need to be simulated, for example, some models require instantaneous jumps when the position reaches a threshold. In these cases, vectorization is not an option and a manual loop could be unavoidable."

    "- **SciPy.weave** (http://www.scipy.org/Weave) is a SciPy subpackage that allows the inclusion of C/C++ code within Python code. \n",
    "- **Numba** (http://numba.pydata.org/) uses just-in-time LLVM compilation to accelerate a pure Python code considerably by compiling it dynamically and transparently. It integrates nicely with NumPy arrays. Its installation requires llvmpy and meta.\n",
    "- **Theano** (http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/), which allows to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions on arrays very efficiently by compiling them transparently on the CPU or on the graphics card. \n",
    "- **Numexpr** (https://code.google.com/p/numexpr/) can compile array expressions and take advantage of vectorized CPU instructions and multi-core processors.\n",
    "- **Blaze** (http://blaze.pydata.org/) is a project that is still in early development at the time of writing, and aims at combining all these dynamic compilation technologies together into a unified framework. It will also extend the notion of multidimensional array by allowing type and shape heterogeneity, missing values, labeled dimensions (such as in Pandas), and so on. Being developed by the creators of NumPy, it is likely to be a central project in the Python computing community in the near future.\n",
    "- Finally, **PyOpenCL** (http://mathema.tician.de/software/pyopencl) and **PyCUDA** (http://mathema.tician.de/software/pycuda) are Python wrappers to **OpenCL** and **CUDA**. These libraries implement C-like, low-level languages that can be compiled on modern graphics cards for taking advantage of their massively parallel architecture. Indeed, graphics cards contain hundreds of specialized cores that can process a function very efficiently on a large number of elements (Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) paradigm). The speed improvement can be more than one order of magnitude faster compared to pure C code. **OpenCL** is an open standard language, whereas **CUDA** is a proprietary language owned by Nvidia Corporation. **CUDA** code runs on **Nvidia** cards only, whereas **OpenCL** is supported by most graphics cards as well as most CPUs. In the latter case, the same code is compiled on the CPU and takes advantage of multi-core processors and vectorized instructions."
