    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we study the maximum likelihood estimation by the **EM algorithm**, a special case of the **MM algorithm **(M stands for minorize and the second M for maximize). At the heart of every **EM algorithm** is some notion of missing data. Data can be missing in the ordinary sense, such as a failure to record certain observations on certain cases, or also  data can also be missing in a theoretical sense. In any case, we can think of the **E-step** (expectation) of the algorithm as filling in the missing data. This action replaces the loglikelihood of the observed data by a minorizing function, which is then maximized in the **M-step**. Because the surrogate function is usually much simpler than the likelihood, we can often solve the **M-step** analytically. The price we pay for this simplification is *iteration*. Reconstruction of the missing data is bound to be slightly wrong if the parameters do not already equal their maximum likelihood estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the advantages of the **EM algorithm** is its numerical stability. As an MM algorithm, any **EM algorithm** leads to a steady increase in the likelihood of the observed data. Thus, the **EM algorithm** avoids wildly overshooting or undershooting the maximum of the likelihood along its current direction of search. Besides this desirable feature, the **EM algorithm** handles parameter constraints gracefully. Constraint satisfaction is by definition built into the solution of the M step. In contrast, competing methods of maximization must employ special techniques to cope with parameter constraints. The **EM algorithm** shares some of the negative features of the more general MM algorithm. For example, the **EM algorithm** often converges at an excruciatingly slow rate in a neighborhood of the maximum point.\n",

    "- Filling in missing data from a sample set\n",
    "- Discovering values of latent variables\n",

    "Let assume now that we keep the result of the previous experiment, head or tail, and we store it in the variable $\\mathbf X$, but assume that we did not record the coin we used. Now we have **missing data**, defined as $\\mathbf Z$, and the problem of estimating $\\mathbf \\theta$ is harder to solve. One way to approach the problem is to ask - can we assign weights $z_j$ defined as $z_j = P(X \\in j)$ for $ j = {A, B}$ to each sample according to how likely it is to be generated from coin $A$ or coin $B$?\n",
