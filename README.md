# IPython_notebooks
Set of iPython (Jupyter) notebooks about Python, Reactive Programming, Statistics, Finance, Data Bases, Optimization, Science in general, Machine Learning, Time-Series... and more

My favourites?

--> CS-Algo Problems: It has more than 30 algorithmic problems about generators, list comprehension, map/reduce/filter problems, decorators... 

--> Doing Science with Python: this one is huge, almost a book... and still work in progress but it contains not only the basics about data containers, or basic algorithms, but also advance hash functions or some functional programming stuff
