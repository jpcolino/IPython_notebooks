[*Jesus Perez Colino*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jesusperezcolino/)


Set of Jupyter (iPython) notebooks (and few pdf-presentations) about things that I am interested on, like *Computer Science*, *Statistics and Machine-Learning*, *Artificial Intelligence (AI)*, *Financial Engineering*, *Optimization*, *Stochastic Modelling*, *Time-Series forecasting*, *Science in general*... and more.

- **NEW:** [**Neural Networks (RNN/LSTM/GRU) for time-series forecasting in Commodities Markets using TensorFlow/Keras** ](https://github.com/jpcolino/IPython_notebooks/blob/master/RNN_LSTM_GRU_for_Hedge_Funds%20_flows.ipynb) 
(Here, just the simplest of the univariate versions. If you are interested in the deep-LSTM multivariate version, contact [me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jesusperezcolino/))

- **NEW:** [**Auto-Machine Learning Model Selection using GridSearchCV**:](https://github.com/jpcolino/IPython_notebooks/blob/master/Automatic%20Machine%20Learning.ipynb) It has some interesting ideas I am working on... hope you like. If you want to know how to go further, please contact [me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jesusperezcolino/)

My favourites?

- [**Algorithmic Problems in Python**](https://github.com/jpcolino/IPython_notebooks/blob/master/Algorithmic%20Problems%20in%20Python.ipynb): *(Computer Science)* It contains more than 60 algorithm problems about generators, list-comprehension, map/reduce/filter problems, decorators, regular expressions, simulations, classes... This is still a *work-in-progress*, but feel free to have a look, and enjoy.

- [**Doing Science with Python**](https://github.com/jpcolino/IPython_notebooks/blob/master/Doing%20Science%20with%20Python.ipynb): *(Python programming)* this one is huge, almost a book... and it is still 'work-in-progress' but it contains not only the basics about data-containers, or basic algorithms, but also advance hash-functions and functional programming... but more specifically, or advanced in Python, maybe you find intriguing the notebooks about [Decorators, Closures and Wrappers](https://github.com/jpcolino/IPython_notebooks/blob/master/Decorators%2C%20Closures%20and%20Wrappers.ipynb) or the one about [Iterables, Generetors and Yield](https://github.com/jpcolino/IPython_notebooks/blob/master/Iterables%2C%20Generetors%20and%20Yield%20in%20Python.ipynb), or related with **High Performance Computation (HPC)** check [HPC Cython vs. Multiprocessing](https://github.com/jpcolino/IPython_notebooks/blob/master/HPC%20Cython%20vs%20Multiprocessing.ipynb) out. Hope you like. 

- [**Doing Statistics with Python**](https://github.com/jpcolino/IPython_notebooks/blob/master/Doing%20Statistics%20with%20Python.ipynb): *(Statisitics and Machine Learning)* Another huge notebook, in fact, I wrote it thinking in a free eBook, but it is quite general (and basic) in terms of statistics.  
  - If you look for some more advanced statistics, but always with Python implementations, have a look to the notebooks of [Volatility Forecasting](https://github.com/jpcolino/IPython_notebooks/blob/master/Time-Series%20Analysis%20and%20Volatility%20Forecast.ipynb), [Outliers detection](https://github.com/jpcolino/IPython_notebooks/blob/master/Multivariate%20Outliers.ipynb) for multivariate datasets, [K-means without Scikit](https://github.com/jpcolino/IPython_notebooks/blob/master/K-Means%20without%20Scikit-Learn.ipynb) or [EM-Algorithm](https://github.com/jpcolino/IPython_notebooks/blob/master/EM_Algorithm.ipynb) for clustering and missing values
  - If you want to go deeper in **Statistics Techniques for Big Data**, maybe you should have a look into the **PCA for Big Data** or into **Regression Techniques for Big Data** notebooks, where I am using **PySpark** and **Apache Spark**. 
  - If you are working in **Machine Learning and Deep Learning**, have a look into one of the Support Vector Machines (SVM) notebooks (e.g. [Cross Validation in SVM](https://github.com/jpcolino/IPython_notebooks/blob/master/Cross-Validation%20in%20SVM.ipynb) or [Classification Metrics with SVM](https://github.com/jpcolino/IPython_notebooks/blob/master/Classification%20Metrics%20with%20SVM.ipynb)) or [Generative Models: Autoencoders and GANs notebook](https://github.com/jpcolino/IPython_notebooks/blob/master/Generative_Models_Autoencoders_and_GANs.ipynb) with **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.
  - If you are interested in knowing how to work in modelling with **MongoDB** in order to store your input/output or model results, have a look to the code of [MongoDB, Numpy and Scikit-learn](https://github.com/jpcolino/IPython_notebooks/blob/master/MongoDB%2C%20Numpy%20and%20Scikit-learn.ipynb) notebook. 

- [**Two-Factor Model**](https://github.com/jpcolino/IPython_notebooks/blob/master/Two_Factor_Model-SimpleVersion.ipynb): *(Stochastic Modelling)* this one is more technical, from the mathematical point of view, but quite interesting if you are working in *commodities modelling, derivatives pricing*, or *risk-management*. This one is the simplest possible version, that made the equivalence between Black-76 and the Two-Factor Model for forward contracts. I will update it soon, with a  more object-oriented version. Stay tuned. If you want to have the full object-oriented version, with *Robust Calibration* of the SDE using *Semidefinite Programming* and unit-testing, contact me.

- **Just for FUN:** If you like Astronomy like me, check this out: [Web-scrapping NASA Astronomy Picture of the day](https://github.com/jpcolino/IPython_notebooks/blob/master/Web-scrapping%20NASA%20Astronomy%20Picture.ipynb)
